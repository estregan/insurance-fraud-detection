# Feature Engineering Report - Insurance Fraud Detection

## Executive Summary
Successfully transformed raw insurance data into 30 optimized features for fraud detection.

## Dataset Transformation
- **Original Dataset:** 15,420 records, 32 features
- **Final Dataset:** 15,420 records, 30 features
- **Target Variable:** Binary fraud classification (5.99% fraud rate)

## Feature Engineering Pipeline

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Missing value imputation using median/mode
- Outlier detection and capping using IQR method
- Data quality validation

### 2. Feature Creation (58 new features)
- **Statistical Transformations:** Log, sqrt, z-score, quartile binning
- **Interaction Features:** Ratios, products, differences between variables
- **Aggregation Features:** Mean encoding and count encoding by categories
- **Temporal Features:** Season mapping, weekend indicators

### 3. Categorical Encoding
- One-hot encoding for low cardinality (≤5 categories)
- Label encoding for medium cardinality (6-15 categories)
- Frequency encoding for high cardinality (>15 categories)

### 4. Feature Selection
- Correlation-based filtering (removed features with >95% correlation)
- Mutual information scoring for statistical importance
- Business relevance evaluation
